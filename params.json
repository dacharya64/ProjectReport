Compatible with iOS and Android smartphones and any smartphone-compatible headset like Google Cardboard, EscapeVR lets you escape from the real world with calming 3D environments. \r\n\r\nFor this project we spent a semester learning about the lean startup process and working to create our own startup from scratch. We started off with a team and an idea, and from there conducted surveys, experiments, and prototype demos to test hypotheses about our idea and see if it was worthwhile. The project culminated in a final presentation in front of judges and the class, as well as a final report and this website about our process. \r\n\r\n## Vision\r\nOur original idea was a virtual reality app that helped encourage people to work out by providing interesting 3D environments for the user to explore while on an exercise bike or treadmill. Following down this path, though, we met a lot of resistance--people were skeptical about whether they would use such an app, and had concerns about the weight of the headset, sweat buildup, and safety. \r\n\r\nWe went back to the drawing board and thought about problems that we could solve for which virtual reality provided a different, beneficial purpose in the given solution. We came up with the idea of virtual reality relaxation, so that anyone with a smartphone, headphones and a Google Cardboard could completely shut themselves off from reality with VR temporarily remove themselves from stressful situations. Users can choose from a variety of calming locations like the beach or the mountains, and instantly take themselves there. \r\n\r\n## Process\r\n###Testing Our Hypotheses\r\nWe set out to test our hypotheses through interviews, surveys, landing pages, and prototype demos. We mainly wanted to test our leap-of-faith hypotheses--whether our users really found stress to be a major pain point for them, and if they were willing to use VR (and particularly our app) to help solve that problem for them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Prototype\r\nWe used VR KiX headsets and standard smartphones (iOS and Android) along with 360 videos found on Youtube to simulate different 3D environments. \r\n\r\nHere's links to the videos we used: \r\nBeach: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtwuQaZ0KQk>\r\nPark: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gly33EsAROY>\r\nMountain Room: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ6aE1jy3o8>\r\n\r\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/92dc7469f45940925cee73fc88608d06.gif)\r\n\r\n###Financial Model \r\n\r\n###Assessing Competitors \r\n\r\n\r\n## About Us / Contact\r\nOur team is VRx, a group of students at Brandeis University interested in making great things.
