Compatible with iOS and Android smartphones and any smartphone-compatible headset like Google Cardboard, EscapeVR lets you escape from the real world with calming 3D environments. \r\n\r\nFor this project we spent a semester learning about the lean startup process and working to create our own startup from scratch. We started off with a team and an idea, and from there conducted surveys, experiments, and prototype demos to test hypotheses about our idea and see if it was worthwhile. The project culminated in a final presentation in front of judges and the class, as well as a final report and this website about our process. \r\n\r\n### Vision\r\nWhy our project is great\r\n\r\n### Process\r\nTalking about all the trials to get to where we are \r\n\r\n### About Us / Contact\r\nOur team is VRx, a group of students at Brandeis University interested in making great things.
